## User Stories

- The user stories are readily available in the GitHub repository, neatly grouped into Epics for enhanced organization. Each user story can be viewed on the project's Kanban board, providing a clear visual representation of the project's progress. To delve deeper into the details of each user story, including acceptance criteria and associated tasks, simply open the corresponding issue in the repository. For comprehensive documentation, a separate file has been created to house all user stories, ensuring convenient access and a thorough understanding of the project requirements.

<br>

## Agile methodology

- During the project development, I embraced an Agile Methodology, leveraging the powerful capabilities of GitHub Projects to create User Stories. Each User Story was meticulously crafted into an issue, encompassing clear acceptance criteria and associated tasks. To ensure streamlined organization, all User Stories were grouped into Milestones, representing the corresponding Epics, following the MOSCOW prioritization technique. For a comprehensive overview of the project's progress and workflow, I invite you to explore our dynamic Kanban board, which can be accessed here.

## Design

### Color Scheme
- I have made the decision to adopt a minimalistic design approach for the website. This choice aims to enhance the visibility of the site's content and detailed information, allowing them to captivate users more effectively.

- The primary color utilized is rgb(49, 49, 156), which conveys a sense of tranquility and reliability. By employing this calm and trustworthy color, we aim to establish a foundation of trust with the user

## Features

### Navbar & Search


- The navbar serves as a crucial element for easy navigation throughout the site. It includes essential links that allow users to explore different sections and pages of the website conveniently. Whether it's accessing specific categories, browsing through listings, or accessing account-related information, the navbar provides a streamlined way to navigate the site.

- The navbar also dynamically updates its links based on the user's state. For example, if a user is logged in, they may see links related to their account, such as profile, settings, or saved items. On the other hand, if a user is not logged in, the navbar may display links for login or registration.

- Additionally, the navbar often incorporates a search bar. This search functionality enables users to search among the various listings available on the site. By simply entering keywords or specific criteria into the search bar, users can quickly find relevant listings, making their browsing experience more efficient and tailored to their preferences.

Overall, the combination of a well-designed navbar and search functionality enhances the user experience by providing intuitive navigation and efficient access to desired content.
