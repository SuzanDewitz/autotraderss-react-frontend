## User Stories

- The user stories are readily available in the GitHub repository, neatly grouped into Epics for enhanced organization. This allows for easy tracking and management of project features. By organizing user stories into Epics, you can get
  a clear visual representation of the project's progress and understand the high-level goals and themes.

- To delve deeper into the details of each user story, including acceptance criteria and associated tasks, simply open the corresponding issue in the repository. Each user story is documented as an issue, providing a centralized location for
  all relevant information. This allows project stakeholders and team members to have a comprehensive understanding of the requirements and the specific tasks involved in implementing each user story.

- In addition to the issue-based documentation, a separate file has been created to house all user stories. This file serves as comprehensive documentation for the project, providing easy access to all user stories and their associated details.
  It ensures that anyone reviewing the project can quickly gain a thorough understanding of the project's requirements without having to navigate through individual issue

<br>

#### User stories for the frontend can be found in a separate internal document [here](https://github.com/SuzanDewitz/autotraderss-react-frontend/blob/main/docs/USERSTORIES.md)
####  Kanban board for the frontend can be found in a separate internal document [here](https://github.com/users/SuzanDewitz/projects/3/views/1)

<br>

## Agile methodology

- During the project development, I embraced an Agile Methodology, leveraging the powerful capabilities of GitHub Projects to create User Stories. Each User Story was meticulously 
  crafted into an issue, encompassing clear acceptance criteria and associated tasks. To ensure streamlined organization, all User Stories were grouped into Milestones, representing the corresponding Epics, following the MOSCOW prioritization technique. For a comprehensive overview of the project's progress and workflow, I invite you to explore our dynamic Kanban board.

## Design

### Color Scheme
- I have made the decision to adopt a minimalistic design approach for the website. This choice aims to enhance the visibility of the site's content and detailed information, allowing them to 
  captivate users more effectively.

- The primary color utilized is rgb(49, 49, 156), which conveys a sense of tranquility and reliability. By employing this calm and trustworthy color, we aim to establish a foundation of trust with the user

<br>

### Typography

- In this project, I have implemented Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the text. Specifically, we have utilized a font called "Lato" for its uniqu
 characteristics and aesthetic appeal. To achieve a visually pleasing and balanced presentation, we have opted for the medium font weight variant of Lato.

- Google Fonts provides a wide range of high-quality fonts that are easily accessible and compatible across different devices and browsers. By incorporating
  Lato with its medium weight, I aim to create a stylistic impression that complements the overall design of the project.

- API Integrations:The "API Integrations" component represents the connections between the backend and frontend systems through APIs. It includes the integration 
  points involved in your Autotrader marketplace, such as Autotrader data retrieval from external sources or communication between the frontend and backend servers.
